# File Sorter and Cleaner
This code allows user to organize and clean up their downloads folder (or any folder) \
I saw how messy and full my downloads folder was and I wanted to clean it up a bit and \
also learn how to create script that can affect files.

## Getting Started
To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your computer. \
Clone the repo locally
